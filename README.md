# LAMMPS tutorials for Beginners

These tutorials were recreated from my original tutorials at Mississippi State University (MSU) Center for Advanced Vehicular Systems (CAVS) website with updates to codes within Jupyter Notebooks.  I hope this helps with everyone's learning curves for LAMMPS!  Thanks.

I've even tried to update the scripts here to some of the newer LAMMPS versions.  So far so good!
